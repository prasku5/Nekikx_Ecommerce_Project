/* 
Explanation:

@tailwind base;, @tailwind components;, @tailwind utilities;:
These are directives used by Tailwind CSS to include the base styles, component styles, and utility styles respectively. They are part of Tailwind's utility-first CSS approach.
html, body, :root { height: 100%; }:

This is regular CSS styling.
It selects the html, body, and :root (which is the root element, often used to define CSS custom properties) and sets their height to 100%.
This is likely done to ensure that the HTML, body, and root element take up the full height of the viewport.
In summary, this code sets up the basic styling for the HTML, body, and root elements using Tailwind CSS. 
It ensures that these elements have a height of 100%, possibly to create a full-height layout. 
The @tailwind directives indicate that Tailwind CSS classes will be used to style these elements, following the utility-first methodology. */
